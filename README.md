Deepfake and Object Detection for military based aircrafts using satellite images

This paper introduces an approach for identifying aircrafts and also detecting deepfake alterations of aircraft in satellite images. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), our approach identifies minor inconsistencies that show digital tampering. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset created using real satellite images and their deepfakes created using said GANs. This research contributes to the crucial task of ensuring the integrity and reliability of remote sensing data in the domain of defense, surveillance, and environmental monitoring.
